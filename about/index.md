Hi there,nice to meet you. My name is Daniel Maina. I made this site to share my passions and projects. I am very interested in understanding the services market, and as a consequence I also poke my brains' fingers into information technology and Business management.


Presently, I am building new oportunities and looking for a team of like-minded people to join.

On the flip-side, I enjoy humor and also writing.

This site is a part of my effort to understand web-development. It has been largely adopted from outstanding open-sourced work done by;

- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rsms) â€” Rasmus Andersson (great developer)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmistakes) - Michael Rose (great artist/developer)
